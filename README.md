# SFML-Doodle-Jump
A remake of Doodle Jump for PC, first C++ SFML game

One important thing to note, I do not own Doodle Jump, all of the credit goes to the creators of the game.
I am simply exploring SFML, playing with game mechanics, and working on a fun project.

Controls are as follows:

  Arrow keys or 'w' and 'd' keys for left and right movement.
  Up arrow or space bar to fire
